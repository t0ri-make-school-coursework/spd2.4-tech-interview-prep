# Youre asked to write recursive FizzBuzz. 
# Your function takes 2 integers: start and end, which are the first 
# and last number in the sequence of integers to return in a list (array).
# However, if the number is a multiple of 3, put “Fizz” in the list 
# instead of the number. If it’s a multiple of 5 put “Buzz” in the list. 
# If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, put “FizzBuzz” in the list.
# Example: 
# fizzbuzz(1, 20)  [1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz]
