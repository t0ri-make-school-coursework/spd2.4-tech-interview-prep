# Problem 1 - Rotate.py
Rotate a given singly-linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes, where k is a given integer.
Example: If the given linked list is A → B → C → D → E → F and k is 4, nodes should be modified so the list becomes E → F → A → B → C → D.
Assumptions: k is positive and smaller than n, the length of the linked list.
